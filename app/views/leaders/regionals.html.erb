<h3 id='chapters'>Chapter membership requirement</h3>
<p>The
<a href="https://www.iac.org/legacy/regional-championship-series-information">
IAC Regional Series</a> 
procedures require (226.2.3.6) pilots competing in a region to be a member of
at least one IAC Chapter in that region to be eligible for a Regional Series
title there.  A pilot competing in more than one
region will be a member of more than one IAC Chapter.
We currently have no method for verifying this; however, be on notice,
we might use chapter number declarations from pilot registration paperwork
to verify the chapter membership requirement.  For now, you are on the honor
system.</p>
