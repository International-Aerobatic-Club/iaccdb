<p>Collegiate team scores are best combination of one non-Primary pilot result
and any category results from two other pilots.
Teams qualify by having a non-Primary competitor at three contests and
three or more pilots at three contests.
Qualifying teams have their place indicated to the left of their name.
</p><p>
Individuals qualify by having at least three contests, at least one not
in Primary. We use the best combination of three scores, including at least one
non-Primary.
Qualifying individuals have their place indicated to the right of their name.

Results are provisional until all contests for the year are
flown and the winner announced.
