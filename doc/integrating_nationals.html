<h1>Integrating IAC Nationals data from CIVA ACRO</h1>
<p>Nationals has been running for many years with the CIVA ACRO software.
This means, in order to compute regional series, collegiate, and L. Paul Soucy results,
we must somehow integrate the outputs from ACRO into this data.
</p><p>
The approach taken here is to screen scrape the ACRO web outputs.
ACRO does have some CSV format outputs; but, it's extra work to get them, the web
screens have the same information, and it's just as easy to scrape the web screens
as to scrape the CSV.
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
All of this work is done from the command line.  There are no admin UI interfaces
for accomplishing it.
</p><p>
The 'cmd/acro' directory contains a number of utilities.  The following assist with
integrating the Nationals results, with brief descriptions:
</p><dl>
<dt>scrape_html_to_yaml.rb </dt><dd> does the screen scraping and generates YAML (.yml) files with the
scraped data.
</dd>
<dt>show_flights.rb </dt><dd> displays the scraped flight names and the detected attributes, as
a check.
</dd>
<dt>memberlist.sql </dt><dd> has the query needed to generate a member list for name resolution
Use it to produce the memberlist.txt file for the resolve_names step.
</dd>
<dt>resolve_names.rb </dt><dd> is an interactive console driven program for identifying the member
records from the names.  It produces a file participants.yml that contains the
mapping from each judge or pilot name in the ACRO files to a member record
</dd>
<dt>import_yml_extracts.rb </dt><dd> reads the pilot-flight raw scores into the database.  It uses the
participants.yml file, if present, to identify member records.
</dd>
<dt>results_list.rb </dt><dd> produces a list of category and flight results, results_list.yml for edit
</dd>
<dt>patch_results.rb </dt><dd> reads category and flight results totals from multi_ yml files, together
with participants.yml and results_list.yml to patch result computations into the 
contest data.
</dl>
<p>
Of all of these, the first utility that touches the contest database is import_yml_extracts.rb.
That writes sequences, judge pairs, pilots, the contest record, and scores.  It kicks-off
a delayed job to compute results from the raw scores.
</p><p>
The computed results will differ from the published results because they do not use
the same computation used by ACRO.  It is useful to run them, however, as they verify
the completeness and integrity of the imported raw grading data.
They also generate the figure ranks and judge metrics.
</p><p>
The second utility that touches the contest database is patch_results.rb.  This overwrites the computed flight and category results for each pilot.
</p>
<h2>Using the utilities for 2014</h2>
<p>Following are detailed steps used to integrate Nationals 2014 results into IACCDB.
</p>
<p>Pull the results postings from the web.  We make a directory for these and change to it
before pulling them.  This keeps them separate from other years, where they would otherwise
overlap.</p>
<p class='code'>mkdir nationals2014
cd nationals2014
wget --mirror --convert-links https://nationals.iac.org/files/results/index.htm</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this does not pull the individual pilot files that contain the grades from the judges.  This is because the links to those are encoded as javascript actions rather than as links.  In order to get them, we run a python script over the downloaded result files:</p>
<p class='code'>cat nationals.iac.org/files/results/link* | python ../cmd/acro/stripPilots.py</p>

<p>Create the contest control file in the directory that contains the downloaded results postings.  This contains the contest meta information needed, see 
<span class='code'>lib/acro/control_file.rb</span> for documentation of the format.
We called this file <span class='code'>contest.yml</span> and its
initial content is as follows:</p>
<p class='code'>---
contestName: 'U.S. National Aerobatic Championships'
startDate: '2014-09-21'
city: 'Sherman and Denison'
state: 'TX'
director: 'Gray Brandt'
</p>

<p>Now we're ready to 
do the screen scraping that generates YAML (.yml) files from the results postings.
For convenience, we move these files up to the nationals subdirectory.</p>
<p class='code'>cd ..
rails runner cmd/acro/scrape_html_to_yaml.rb nationals2014/nationals.iac.org/files/results/contest.yml
mv nationals2014/nationals.iac.org/files/results/*.yml nationals2014</p>
<p>
In 2014 the pilot flights for Unlimited Power Unknown and Team Unknown both have the
same name, 'Unlimited - Power : Free Unknown Sequence'.  It is necessary to identify
all of the <span class='code'>pilot_p*s28.htm.yml</span>
files and substitute a unique flight title.
Either that or use the sequence identifier in the name to disambiguate.
We would manually produce a file that maps id's to flights.
Easier this round to simply disambiguate the description in the files.
</p>
<p class='code'>sed -e '2 s/Free Unknown Sequence/Free Unknown Team Sequence/' 
</p><p>
Now that said, we need to leave the Team Unknown out of the picture.
It isn't part of the competition, only a team selection flight.
So, to be pragmatic, delete those pilot_flight records entirely
and delete the team result overall posting as well</p>
<p class='code'>rm nationals2014/pilot_p*s28.htm.yml
rm nationals2014/multi_R012s08s17s26s28.htm.yml</p>

<p>Before we import this data into IACCDB, we have to ensure that the pilot names
used in the ACRO files will match member names as used in IACCDB.  Without this important
step, we get duplicate pilots with different name spellings in IACCDB.  Some pilots 
and judges don't
get proper credit for the Nationals flights because they have two identities.
We can run pilot and judge name resolution, so that names match to the correct 
members on import.
</p><p>
First, generate the member file. We didn't write a program for this, rather, we simply
run a SQL query against the database.
</p>
<p class='code'>mysql --defaults-extra-file=./.my.cnf iaccdb &lt;cmd/acro/memberlist.sql &gt;nationals2014/memberlist.txt</p>
<p>Now we run the member name matching program.  Because it is interacive, we run it as a ruby
program.  (The rails runner is non-interactive.)
</p>
<p class='code'>ruby cmd/acro/resolve_names.rb nationals2014/contest.yml</p>
<p>
This presents a dialog with the found name and suggested name matches for each pilot
and judge in the ACRO resuts files.
We select the correct member record for the name presented.
The program outputs a name resolution file, <span class='code'>participants.yml</code.
that matches ACRO entered names to member records.</p>
<p>With the name resolution done, we can import the pilot flight data-- all of the grades.
This is the first command that writes to the database, so we first make a back-up.
</p>
<p class='code'>mysqldump --defaults-extra-file=./.my.cnf iaccdb &gt;20141030pre-nats.sql
rails runner cmd/acro/import_yml_extracts.rb nationals2014/contest.yml
</p>
<p>The command creates the contest and all of the grades in the database.
It leaves an asynchronous task to make the IAC results computations.
If the jobs worker is not already running on the server, Run 
<span class='code'>rake jobs:workoff</span>.  
The job computes results from the imported data.  
We need this to have the result records and judge metrics.
It takes some time to run.  That is a subject for investigation.
</p><p>
Run <span class='code'>ruby cmd/acro/resolve_names.rb</span> a second time, 
or edit the <span class='code'>participants.yml</span> file with id's of newly 
created members.  Better to edit the file and search for nil, then fill-out the
entry in the format of the others:
</p>
<p class='code'>Jim Johnson: !ruby/object:ACRO::ParticipantList::Participant
  db_id: '617'
  given_name: Jim
  family_name: Johnson
  iad_db_id: '0'</p>
<p>We are not readily able to specify IAC id's, so leave them zero.
Find the db_id, which is the most important value, by browsing the contest online.
Find the pilot or judge and check their link URL:
</p><p class='code'>https://iaccdb.iac.org/pilots/2552/scores/456</p>
<p>The number after "pilots", 2552 in the example, is the db_id.
These numbers will be consecutive, newly created id numbers.</p>
<p>

Edit the contest.yml file with the id of the contest.  Find the id of the contest
in the URL,</p>
<p class='code'>https://iaccdb.iac.org/contests/456</p>
<p>The number after contests, 456 in the example, is the contest id.
The contest.yml control file should now have an additional line,</p>
<p class='code'>---
contestName: 'U.S. National Aerobatic Championships'
startDate: '2014-09-21'
city: 'Sherman and Denison'
state: 'TX'
director: 'Gray Brandt'
contest_id: 456
</p>
<p>We can usually identify the category, and possibly line-up the flight names from
the overall results postings with the flights in the individual pilot files.  Rather than
take a chance with heuristic matching, however, it's straightforward to manually
identify the flights in the overall results files with flights now present in the
iac database.  To generate the list of flights, run</p>
<p class='code'>rails runner cmd/acro/results_list.rb ~/iaccdb/shared/nationals2014/contest.yml</p>
<p>This produces a file, <span class='code'>results_list.yml</span> which we edit.
Wherever we find 'missing_id' we insert the correct iac database id for the flight result.
Find the database id's in the url's for the flights, for example:</p>
<p class='code'>https://iaccdb.iac.org/flights/6653</p>
<p>has database id 6653. Take care because the flights for a category do not
necessarily display in the same order in the file as on the results display.</p>

<p>Now patch the IAC computed results with the results computed by ACRO.  They are different.
</p><p class='code'>rails runner cmd/acro/patch_results.rb nationals2014/contest.yml</p>
<p>Compare the posted overall category and flight result scores with those
in the original ACRO posted results.  If they match, all is well.</p>
<p>
With Nationals loaded, we recompute the regionals.</p>
<p class='code'>rails runner cmd/recompute_regionals.rb 2014</p>
<p>Take care not to queue a job to recompute the contest, else the patched results
are overwritten.</p>
