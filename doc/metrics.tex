\[
\rho\rho = 1- {\frac {6 \sum {d_p}^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}}
\]

$d_p = x_p - y_p$ where $x_p$ is the individual judge ranking of pilot $p$ and $y_p$
is the result ranking of the pilot.

$n$ is the number of pilots ranked.

\[
 \rho = \frac{\sum_p(x_p-\bar{x})(y_p-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_p (x_p-\bar{x})^2 \sum_p(y_p-\bar{y})^2}}
\]

$x_p$ and $y_p$ are judge and result ranks for pilot p adjusted for ties.  
When $1 < m$ pilots have the same rank $r$, 
the values for $x_p$ (or $y_p$) are the average $r + (m - 1)/2$ 
of the positions they cover.  For example, with three tied for
third, $x_p$ is $(3+4+5)/3 = 3 + (3-1)/2 = 4$.

$\bar{x} = \bar{y} = (n+1)/2$ is the average of the ranks.

\[
\tau = \frac{N_c-N_d}{\frac{1}{2} n (n-1) }
\]

$N_c$ is the number of concordant pairs.  $N_d$ is the number of
discordant pairs.  $n$ is the number of pilots ranked.
${1/2}n(n-1)$ is the number of pairs.

\[
\gamma=\frac{N_c-N_d}{N_c+N_d}
\]

$N_c$ is the number of concordant pairs.  $N_d$ is the number of
discordant pairs.
