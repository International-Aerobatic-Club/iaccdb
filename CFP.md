## Call for proposals, IACCDB

This project (IACCDB) needs a maintainer. If you would like to volunteer, please choose an issue, get in touch, and make a pull request.  The project is viewed by a couple of thousand people and the usual number of robots. You can use it as an open source reference to show competence in Ruby and Ruby on Rails (RoR). The project is light on Javascript, more or less intentionally although not as a matter of policy.

If you are a software development organization, please send a proposal to the International Aerobatic Club (IAC) Executive Director as execdir@iac.org. The presence of this call indicates that proposals are still wanted.

The proposal can take your usual format; however, the following types of service are desired:

- fixed price annual retainer for:
   - maintaining a current, deployed and operating version at iaccdb.iac.org, including automated deployment and web server configuration.  The application is currrently deployed with Capistrano 2 to nginx + passenger.
   - applying and deploying security patches to Ruby and Ruby gems in use, as they arise
   - upgrading the code base and deploying to fresh versions of Ruby according to the Ruby support schedule.
   - upgrading the code base to the latest .1 or greater patch level and .1 or greater minor level (https://semver.org/) of Ruby on Rails when these versions are released.  For example, 5.2.6 to 6.0.* or 6.1.0 is not required. The first upgrade from 5.2.6 would be 5.2.7, 5.3.1, or 6.1.1.

     We've made this part of the fixed price portion because otherwise it won't be budgeted and completed. Hopefully your shop has sufficient experience with RoR to have a good feel for the average amount of RoR upgrade churn encountered over a year.
- an hourly rate for making changes and improvements requested by IAC.
- some indication of the number and experience of RoR developers on hand
- some indication of the depth of RoR project experience existing in your shop.

Software development organizations will be preferred over individual contractors due to their ability to maintain a pool of individuals with relevant skills and provide relative continuity of service as people come and go.
