## IAC Contest Database - Call for Proposals

This project (IACCDB) needs a maintainer. If you would like to volunteer,
please choose an
[issue](https://github.com/wbreeze/iaccdb/issues),
get in touch, and make a
[pull request](https://github.com/wbreeze/iaccdb/pulls).
The project is
viewed by a couple thousand people and the usual number of robots. You can use
it as an open-source reference to show competence in Ruby and Ruby on Rails
(RoR). The project is light on JavaScript, more or less intentionally although
not as a matter of policy.

If you’re a software development organization and you’re interested, please
send a proposal to the International Aerobatic Club (IAC) Executive Director
Stephen Kurtzahn at execdir@iac.org.

The proposal can take your usual format; however, the following
services are desired:

- Maintaining a current, deployed and operating version at
  [iaccdb.iac.org](https://iaccdb.iac.org/),
  including automated deployment and web server configuration. The application
  is currently deployed with Capistrano 2 to nginx + passenger
- Applying and deploying security patches to Ruby and Ruby gems in use, as they
  arise
- Upgrading the code-base and deploying to fresh versions of Ruby according to
  the Ruby support     schedule
- Upgrading the code base to the latest .1 or greater patch level and .1 or
  greater minor level (see [semver.org](https://semver.org/))
  of Ruby on Rails when these versions
  are released. For example, 5.2.6 to 6.0.* or 6.1.0 is not required. The first
  upgrade from 5.2.6 would be 5.2.7, 5.3.1, or 6.1.1

There will be a fixed-price annual retainer for these items. Hopefully your
shop has sufficient experience with RoR to have a good feel for the average
amount of RoR upgrade churn encountered over a year.

We would also like you to share with us:

- Your hourly rate for making changes and improvements requested by the IAC
- Some indication of the number and experience of RoR developers on hand
- Some indication of the depth of RoR project experience existing in your shop

Software development organizations are preferred over individual contractors
due to their ability to maintain a pool of individuals with relevant skills and
provide relative continuity of service as people come and go.

Thank you.
