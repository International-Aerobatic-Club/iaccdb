* contest_data directory
The contest_data directory contains a sample group of contest data files for testing.
The newContest.yml is the contest information file for that contest.
The spec that converts contest data to dot-yml files generates a slew of
*.htm.yml files in the contest_data directory. It removes all *.htm.yml files
in the contest_data directory at the end of the test.

* sample_data directory
The sample_data directory contains random files for testing.
